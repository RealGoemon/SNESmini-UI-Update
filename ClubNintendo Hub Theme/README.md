# SNESmini-UI-Update
A graphical UI Update for the SNES Classic mini

In order to use this themes you need:
Options Menu v1.3.4
https://github.com/CompCom/OptionsMenu/releases/tag/1.3.4
and the latest version of Defkorns Theme Selector:
https://github.com/DefKorns/om_theme-selector

Place the themes you like into the hakchi themes folder on your USB stick.
The themes:
nintendo_super_famicom_box and nec_-_pc_engine
are meant to be used as "hub themes" just to browse/access folders/systems.
Do not place any games there because all the suspension point functions are deactivated.

To use the intended folder structure, just place the folders from "hakchi2-ce-3.9.3 Stuff" into your hakchi folder.
Be aware that this overwrites your own folder settings.

All the needed game icon art can be found in "SFCBox_menu_icons" and "BS-X_game_icons".
Additional borders can be found in "borders"
